Goal : design and deploy a minimal two‑subnet network, prove end‑to‑end connectivity, then add basic optimisation services (DHCP).
Additional services such as DNS and an edge firewall will be introduced in later iterations.

✨ Objectives

Build the physical architecture – connect the switches, router and end‑devices.

Create two IPv4 subnets that can route traffic between each other.

Validate connectivity (ICMP & application‑layer tests).

Optimise with a central DHCP service.
